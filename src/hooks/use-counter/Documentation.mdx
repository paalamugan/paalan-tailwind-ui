# useCounter

`useCounter` is a React hook that provides a counter and a set of functions to manipulate it. It is useful for creating a counter that can be incremented, decremented, reset, or set to a specific value.

## Usage

### Example

<Canvas of={allStories.Usage} />

### Code

<Source of={allStories.Usage} />

## Parameters

- `initialValue` (number) - The initial value of the counter. Defaults to `0`.
- `options` - An object containing options for the hook.
  - `min` (number) - The minimum value of the counter. Defaults to `-Infinity`.
  - `max` (number) - The maximum value of the counter. Defaults to `Infinity`.

## Returns

`useCounter` returns a tuple containing the current count and an object with increment, decrement, set and reset functions.

- `value` (number) - The current value of the counter.
- `increment` (function) - A function that increments the counter by a given amount. If no amount is provided, the counter is incremented by `1`.
- `decrement` (function) - A function that decrements the counter by a given amount. If no amount is provided, the counter is decremented by `1`.
- `reset` (function) - A function that resets the counter to its initial value.
- `set` (function) - A function that sets the counter to a given value.
