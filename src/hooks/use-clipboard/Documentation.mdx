# useClipboard

`useClipboard` is a React hook that copies text to the clipboard. It returns a `copy` function that takes a string to copy to the clipboard. It also returns a `copied` boolean that indicates whether the copy was successful.

## Usage

### Example

### Code

<Source of={allStories.Usage} />

## Parameters

`Options` - An optional object that can be passed to `useClipboard` to configure its behavior.

- `timeout` - The number of milliseconds to wait before resetting the `copied` boolean to `false`. Defaults to `2000`.

## Returns

`useClipboard` returns an object with the following properties:

- `copy` - A function that takes a string to copy to the clipboard.
- `copied` - A boolean that indicates whether the copy was successful. This boolean is reset to `false` after the number of milliseconds specified by the `timeout` option.
- `reset` - A function that resets the `copied` boolean to `false`.
- `error` - An error that occurred during the copy process.
- `hasCopied` - A boolean that indicates whether the copy was successful.
