# useClickOutside

`useClickOutside` is a react hook that allows you to detect clicks outside of a given element.
It returns a ref that you can attach to any element.
When a click occurs outside of that element, the `onClickOutside` callback will be called.
This is useful for detecting clicks outside of a modal or dropdown menu.

## Usage

### Example

<Canvas of={allStories.Usage} />

### Code

<Source of={allStories.Usage} />

## Parameters

- `handler` - A callback function that will be called when a click occurs outside of the element.
- `events` - An array of event names to listen for. Defaults to `['mousedown', 'mouseup', 'touchstart', 'touchend']`.
- `nodes` - The list of elements to ignore clicks outside of. If not provided, the listener will be attached to the element passed as a ref.

## Returns

`useClickOutside` returns a ref that you can attach to any element.
When a click occurs outside of that element, the `onClickOutside` callback will be called.

- `ref` - A ref that should be attached to the element you want to detect clicks outside of.
