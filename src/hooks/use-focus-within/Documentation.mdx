# useFocusWithin

`useFocusWithin` is a React hook that detects if any element within the other element has focus. It works the same way as `:focus-within` CSS selector:

## Usage

### Example

<Canvas of={allStories.Usage} />

### Code

<Source of={allStories.Usage} />

## Parameters

- `options` - an object with the following properties:
  - `onBlur` - a callback that is called when any element outside the other element loses focus
  - `onFocus` - a callback that is called when any element inside the other element gains focus

## Returns

`useFocusWithin` returns a object with the following properties:

- `ref` - a React ref that should be passed to the element that should be checked for focus within
- `focused` - a boolean that indicates if any element within the other element has focus
