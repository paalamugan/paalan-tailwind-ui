# useIdle

`useIdle` is a React hook that fires a callback when the user is idle.

## Usage

### Example

<Canvas of={allStories.Usage} />

### Code

<Source of={allStories.Usage} />

### Example - With Custom Event

By default, the hook will listen to `keypress`, `mousemove`, `touchmove`, `click` and `scroll` events to set idle status. To change that, provide a list of events in the `options` argument:

<Canvas of={allStories.WithCustomEvent} />

### Code - With Custom Event

<Source of={allStories.WithCustomEvent} />

### Example - With Initial State

By default, the hook will return an idle state. To change that, provide an initial state value in the `options` argument:

<Canvas of={allStories.WithInitialState} />

### Code - With Initial State

<Source of={allStories.WithInitialState} />

## Parameters

`useIdle` accepts a two parameter:

- `timeout` - the number of milliseconds before the user is considered idle
- `options` - an object with the following optional properties:
  - `events` - an array of event names that should be considered user activity
  - `initialState` - a boolean that indicates whether the user is initially idle

## Returns

`useIdle` returns a boolean that indicates whether the user is idle.
