# useScrollLock

`useScrollLock` is a React hook that prevents scrolling of the document body when a target element is focused. This is useful for modals, dropdowns, and other components that require the user to interact with them before continuing.

## Usage

### Example

<Canvas of={allStories.Usage} />

### Code

<Source of={allStories.Usage} />

## Parameters

`useScrollLock` accepts two parameters:

- `lock` - a boolean value that indicates whether or not to lock scrolling. When `true`, scrolling is locked. When `false`, scrolling is unlocked.
- `options` - An object containing options to customize the scroll lock behavior.
  - `disableBodyPadding` - a boolean value that indicates whether or not to disable body padding when scrolling is locked. When `true`, body padding is disabled. When `false`, body padding is not disabled. Defaults to `false`.

## Returns

`useScrollLock` returns a tuple containing the current scroll lock state and a function to update the scroll lock state.
