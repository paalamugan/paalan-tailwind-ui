# useConst

`useConst` is a React hook that returns a constant value. Even if `useMemo` is provided an empty array as its final argument, it doesn't offer a guarantee that it won't re-run for performance reasons later on. By using `useConst` you can ensure that initializers don't execute twice or more.

## Usage

### Example - With Value

<Canvas of={allStories.WithValue} />

### Code - With Value

<Source of={allStories.WithValue} />

### Example - With Function

<Canvas of={allStories.WithFunction} />

### Code - With Function

<Source of={allStories.WithFunction} />

## Parameters

`init` - A function that returns the value to be stored in the constant. This function will only be called once.

## Returns

`useConst` returns the value returned by the `init` function.
